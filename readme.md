# About

The APSA Religion & Politics Early Career Workshop was organized by [Shayla Olson](https://shaylafolson.org/), [Amy Erica Smith](http://amyericasmith.org/), and [Hilary Zedlitz](https://www.hzedlitz.com/). We designed this workshop as an opportunity for graduate students, post-docs, and non-tenure track faculty to get feedback on their work. The workshop will be held in the early summer to give participants time to implement feedback from the workshop in time for the fall conference cycle.

The workshop will be held virtually and is open to the public ([register here](https://umich.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwqcemrpzkiGtCCd5xZecFUqoUrJNUTYorN)). We invite scholars at all stages to come listen and provide feedback to our presenters.
