# About

The APSA Religion & Politics Early Career Workshop was organized by [Shayla Olson](https://shaylafolson.org/), [Amy Erica Smith](http://amyericasmith.org/), and Hilary Zedlitz. We designed this workshop as an opportunity for graduate students, post-docs, and non-tenure track faculty to get feedback on their work. The workshop will be held in the early summer to give participants time to implement feedback from the workshop in time for the fall conference cycle.

The workshop will be held virtually and is open to the public (link TBA). We invite scholars at all stages to come listen and provide feedback to our presenters.

# Schedule

The workshops will run on **Tuesdays from 2-4pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)**, from May 25th to June 15th.The full schedule will be released soon. Check back here for workshop Zoom link.
